# ElectronApp

Obviously this one is quite different from the other front end projects as it is a desktop application and not a browser based web front end. Although, as anyone who has worked with Electron before knows, it is sort of technically a browser of its own (and hence uses a lot of familiar elements such as a `package.json`, Webpack, a DOM like structure, etc).
