# AngularApp

Just one note I wanted to add about the configuration files (`angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, etc): I am not entirely sure which parts of each file are even necessary. My goal is to return to this one day and prune the unneeded and unused configuration definitions.
